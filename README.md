Welcome to Black Sheep

THE GAME

Black Sheep is a logic game written in python.
To run the game upload or clone the repo to your codespace (for sum reason it doesn't run in Github codespaces),
Make sure you have pygame installed in your codespace (run "pip install pygame" command in your terminal).
Then run the Main.py file ("python Main.py" in the terminal), and the opening page of the game will appear.
Follow the instructions in the instructions page, and enjoy your time...

THE CODE

The game uses pygame library as its GUI.
The code is built by using modular OOP, Whith objects like buttons, input boxes, backgrounds for handling interactive pages etc.
The main page consists of a board object, Which is a child of the background object, and more faetures like balls and black sheep,
that are supposed to be dragged and removed through the game, 
The main game uses also an algorithm to control the possible movements and mark them, and to handle a series being finished, wehther solved successfully or not.
Note that the backgrounds and button objects are modular and work well togather, so that you can easily iintegrate them into your game or use them (maybe with sum matches) for your purpose.
I'll be happy you'd share your opinion with me, So if there're corrections or suggestions for improving this game, or bugs you've found, let me know, I'll be thankfull to you.
